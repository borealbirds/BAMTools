# INTRODUCTION

The boreal region of Canada hosts one of the most diverse bird communities in North America, comprised
of more than 300 species. During the summer, more than 300 bird species and up to three billion individual birds breed
in the region, leading to its characterization as a North American bird nursery. Historically, these forests have
been subject to little widespread development pressure, and access has been extremely limited, resulting in a
corresponding gap in research and monitoring. However, pressures are mounting, and with the rapid development
of the boreal forest that is presently occurring, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of changing
habitats on boreal bird populations in order to inform management actions. There has been a recent surge
of boreal bird studies across Canada, thus it is timely to undertake a synthesis of existing research, and as a first step towards scenario analysis and decision-support, formulate habitat-based predictive models of species
abundance and distribution for Canadian boreal forests. We envision a series of spatially-explicit, bird-habitat
models, broadly accessible to all organizations interested in boreal conservation planning, and updated regularly
with monitoring data and new research results. The objective of the BAM Avian DB is to assemble and harmonize existing data sets on all boreal forest birds and their habitats through cooperative efforts with boreal bird researchers and associated agencies.

# BAM AVIAN DATABASE
The Boreal Avian Modelling (BAM) Project has been assembling a comprehensive database of systematic, spatially referenced, observational data on boreal birds that have been collected in the boreal and hemiboreal regions of Canada and the United States. Our primary focus is point-count data. This standardized survey technique, used widely in avian research, is well suited for evaluating habitat requirements of forest songbirds.

To date, we have compiled much of the point-count data collected in the Canadian boreal forest since 1993. The avian data set contains information from more than 135 individual research projects comprising more than 100 000 off-road point-count locations, and over 1 million bird records. Approximately 100 bird species are represented. Recent data compilation efforts have resulted in the acquisition of the majority of geo-referenced point-count survey data from across boreal and Arctic Alaska. Efforts continue to acquire data from the hemiboreal region across North America including the Upper Midwest and New England areas of the US.

## Database Structure

The Avian Database contains the observational survey data contributed from all projects, standardized into a common format and ready to use in analyses. The observational data and covariates are maintained in a relational database to facilitate data handling by users. It consists of four hierarchical normalized tables - Projects metadata, Station locations, Sampling events and Point Count data- that are all connected using unique key identifier (Figure 1). 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Relational Boreal Avian database schema", out.width = '90%', fig.align='center', fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/Rationals.jpg")
```

Description of the four tables is listed below: 

1. Project Summary Table – Preserves essential metadata for each project, including sampling protocol employed, and any restrictions on data use;
2. XY Table – value that pertain geographic coordinates for each survey location;
3. PKEY Table – values that pertain to data and time of visit to a particular survey location, as well as observer identity if available and included; 
4. Point Count Table – values that pertain the actual survey information, such as the number of individuals of each species detected, any information about distance to the detected species, the time of detection relative to survey initiation, and available information on the bird’s behavior.


The main body of this report defines each of the four tables and tabulates the attributes and their characteristics. A summary of the data structure and data dictionary is also presented for each table. Maintaining this information within the database ensures consistent classifications across users, and prevents repetition of background searches on life history information each time a new analysis is undertaken.

## Project Summary Table

The BAM database contains contributed data from 135 distinct projects. Projects are sets of data contributed by a single owner or entity. In principle, all data within a single contributed project were collected under a common survey protocol. The two most important elements of a survey protocol are the sampling duration (DURMET) (e.g. 5, 10) and the sampling distance or radius (DISTMET) (e.g. 50m, 100m, unlimited distance) (Table 1). Other components of a sampling protocol include the number of years over which the study was conducted, and the number of visits per year. These characteristics are not always uniform for all surveyed locations within a project. The field Method allow to distinguish within a project difference in sampling duration and distance.   

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
options(kableExtra.latex.load_packages = FALSE)
library(kableExtra)

wfolder <-getwd()
csv_ps <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_ProjectSummary.csv")
tbl_ps <- read.csv(file = csv_ps, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tblps_title <- "Project Summary Table Structure"
kable(tbl_ps, "latex", longtable = T, booktabs = T, caption = tblps_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= c("repeat_header","hold_position"))  %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20em")
```

### PCODE
Each Project is assigned a unique code (PCODE) which links to data sharing agreements, and also serves as a key to relate project information to stations (Table 2). A single project can however use different methodology. To link project information to observations found in PointCount Table, use Method field. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("\n")

csv_01 <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_pcode.csv")
tbl_01 <- read.csv(file = csv_01, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl01_title <- "List of PCODE used in BAM Avian DB v4"
kable(tbl_01, "latex", longtable = T, booktabs = T, caption = tbl01_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options = c("repeat_header"))

```


### Durmeth
Durmeth is the duration protocol used during the survey. Observations were recorded using time interval classes. For example, in a 5 minutes point count survey, time intervals classes could be splitted into 0-3min and 3-5 minutes. Unit is in minutes (Table 3).


```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_durMeth <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_DurationMethodology.csv")
tbl_durMeth <- read.csv(file = csv_durMeth, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl_durMeth_title <- "List of Duration Methodology Class"
kable(tbl_durMeth, "latex", longtable = T, booktabs = T, caption = tbl_durMeth_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE, align = c('c','l')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= c("repeat_header","hold_position"))
```


### Distmeth
Dismeth is the distance protocols over which data were recorded during a survey. Some protocols stratified observations using interval class (also called detection radius), such as less than 50m, 50-100m and greater than 100m. Distance unit is in meters (Table 4).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_distMeth <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_DistanceMethodology.csv")
tbl_distMeth <- read.csv(file = csv_distMeth, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl_distMeth_title <- "List of Distance Methodology Class"
kable(tbl_distMeth, "latex", longtable = T, booktabs = T, caption = tbl_distMeth_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE, align = c('c','l')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= c("repeat_header"))
```

### ChangeMethod, Site_Fix, Use restricted and BBS
ChangeMethod, Site_Fix, Use restricted and BBS fields used Boolean data type where 1 means Yes and 0 means No (Table 5). For example, a project that has ChangeMethod = 0 indicates that the method didn't change at any point in the project (over years or within year). 
\newline
```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_changeMeth <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_yesno.csv")
tbl_changeMeth <- read.csv(file = csv_changeMeth, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl_changeMeth_title <- "Boolean Code Description"
kable(tbl_changeMeth, "latex", booktabs = T, caption = tbl_changeMeth_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE, align = c('c','l')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= "hold_position")
```


## XY Table 
Stations are the geographically referenced locations where individual point counts were conducted. Each station
is linked to a Project via PCODE,and the location is recorded in geographic coordinates. A unique key
(SS) is assigned to each station. In constructing the key, we used as far as possible the project-specific
naming conventions; this allows us preserve some features of the sampling designs for individual projects,
and to identify groups of stations that should potentially be grouped in random effects models. We allow
one level of grouping within projects, and stations are numbered within groups. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_ps <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_XY.csv")
tbl_ps <- read.csv(file = csv_ps, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tblps_title <- "XY Table Structure"
kable(tbl_ps, "latex", booktabs = T, caption = tblps_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9,  latex_options= "hold_position")   %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20em")
```

There is also a unique numeric identifier (ID_link) assigned to each station, independent of the constructed key. This table may also include one or more records spatially locating the station within ecoregions, BCRs or other geographic
zonations that can be coded as factors. However, such attributes are not guaranteed to be maintained
across database versions, and should properly be located in a separate table linked by (SS).

###Timezone  
 There are duplicates and typo. The DB should be checked and fixed prior to update csv
 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_timezone <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_TimeZone.csv")
tbl_timezone <- read.csv(file = csv_timezone, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl_timezone_title <- "TimeZone Code Description"
kable(tbl_timezone, "latex", booktabs = T, caption = tbl_timezone_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE, align = c('c','l')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= "hold_position")
```

 ###OnRoad 
For now, I have no clue what those codes means. Should be confirmed by Trish
\newline
```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_onRoad <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_OnRoad.csv")
tbl_onRoad <- read.csv(file = csv_onRoad, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl_onRoad_title <- "OnRoad Code Description"
kable(tbl_onRoad, "latex", booktabs = T, caption = tbl_onRoad_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE, align = c('c','l')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= "hold_position")
```

## PKEY Table 

PKEY table represents the individual point counts information such as date, time, observer, etc. Rounds record the year, calendar date and clock time when data were collected at a station. Clock time is time-zone corrected given the location and date of sampling. For stations with multiple visits within years, a Round number is also recorded. Dates are also recorded as Julian dates and relative to the start of the local growing season, as determined by custom interpolated climate data. Times are also recorded relative to local nautical(?) sunrise at the geographic coordinates and date of sampling. Each Visit is assigned a unique PKEY composed of SS, a two-character code for sampling year (e.g. 99 = 1999, 07 = 2007) and the Round.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_ps <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_PKEY.csv")
tbl_ps <- read.csv(file = csv_ps, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tblps_title <- "PKEY Table Structure"
kable(tbl_ps, "latex", booktabs = T, caption = tblps_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9,  latex_options= "hold_position")   %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20em")
```

## Point Count Table  

Point counts table represents the actual observations recorded at each point counts. An observation is defined by a species code and an abundance. Standard OAU codes are used for species. In addition, each observation is assigned a distance class (Table 11), a time interval class (table 12), and a behavioural code (Table 13). These codes and classes are described in detail below.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_ps <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_PointCount.csv")
tbl_ps <- read.csv(file = csv_ps, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tblps_title <- "PointCount Table Structure"
kable(tbl_ps, "latex", longtable = T, booktabs = T, caption = tblps_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9,  latex_options= c("repeat_header","hold_position"))   %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20em")
```


###Distance
Distance repesents the distance interval class during which the observation was recorded. Among projects, distance range varies between 0 to unlimited split in various interval class specific to each project. Please refer to DISTMETH table (Table 4) to know more about the distance protocol used by the project.  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_dst <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_Distance.csv")
tbl_dst <- read.csv(file = csv_dst, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl_dst_title <- "Distance Code Description"
kable(tbl_dst, "latex", longtable = T, booktabs = T, caption = tbl_dst_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE, align = c('c','c', 'l')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= c("repeat_header","hold_position"))
```

###Duration
Duration repesents the period interval during which the observation was recorded. As for distance, duration varies greatly among projects starting with a duration range starting from 3 min to more than 10 minutes count survey. Range are splitted in various interval class specific to each project. Please refer to DURMETH table (Table 3) to know more about duration protocol used by the project. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_period <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_Duration.csv")
tbl_period <- read.csv(file = csv_period, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl_period_title <- "Period Code Description"
kable(tbl_period, "latex",longtable = T,booktabs = T, caption = tbl_period_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE, align = c('c','l', 'c')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= c("repeat_header","hold_position"))
```

###Behaviour
Behaviour indicates if the detection was visual, auditory, or both. It also includes flyovers and flythroughs separately, record sex, age, activity/behaviour data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
csv_BEH <- file.path(wfolder, "/data/tbl_BEH.csv")
tbl_BEH <- read.csv(file = csv_period, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE)

tbl_BEH_title <- "Behaviour Code Description"
kable(tbl_BEH, "latex", booktabs = T, caption = tbl_BEH_title, linesep = "", row.names = FALSE, align = c('c','l')) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9, latex_options= "hold_position")
```
