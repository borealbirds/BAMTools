This script uses an ESRI shapefile study region and an ESRI shapefile of the BAM point dataset. It buffers the study region according to an incremental vector of buffer and intersects the BAM dataset with them. It then saves the results of the intersection inside an output working directory. List of SS points intersected are stored in csv files. 

```{r Intersect BAM pts with a vector of incremental buffers}
require(rgeos)
require(rgdal)
require(raster)


# Set wd where spatial data are
wd<-"F:/MelinaStuff/request/FranciscoDenes/MooseCree"

# Read study region and BAMpts shp from the current working dir
BAMpts<-readOGR(dsn=wd, layer="BAM_Homelands_wBuff500")
studyRegion<-readOGR(dsn=wd,layer="Homelands_Boundary_srid92001")
#plot(studyRegion)

# Vector of incremental buffer, must follow unit of the proj4srting chosen. Here buffers are in meters
incBuff<-c("0","50000","100000","150000","200000","250000","300000","350000","400000","450000","500000")

# Buffer / intersetc / save SS as list in csv file / save spatial R obj in shapefile
lapply(incBuff, function(x) {
                    srBuff <-gBuffer(studyRegion, width=as.numeric(x),quadsegs=35)
                    results <-intersect(BAMpts, srBuff)
                    outf <- paste0("BAM_pts_wBuff",x)
                    write.table(results$SS, file.path(wd,"output",paste0(outf,".csv")), row.names=FALSE, col.names=c("SS"))
                    writeOGR(results, file.path(wd,"output"), outf, driver="ESRI Shapefile")
})
